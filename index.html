    <h2><b>Why Choose yourSpace?</b></h2>
    <p>The answer is simple; yourSpace is meant for you, and it's constantly evolving to fit your needs. yourSpace is a way to organize your busy life, through a easy-to-use interface and through effective tools you can use to maximize productivity. 
        Within these tools, there is a "todo list", where you can plan the tasks you need to accomplish. Through a minimalistic interface which gives you a feeling of satisfaction every time you complete a task, you will be kept on track and committed to completing your goals! There is also a "productivity mode", where you can effectively block out any websites that might be a distraction to you. There's also a space where you can self-meditate through controlled breathing or through relaxing music. And, whenever you open a new tab, a motivational quote, with a variety of different backgrounds, will keep you motivated throughout your daily tasks. yourSpace isn't just a way to be more productive, it's a way to gain inner peace and be the <i> <b> amazing person you were meant to be </b></i>.

    <h2><b>Future Updates (v1.2.0 and v1.3.0)</b></h2>
    <h3>v1.2.0</h3>
    <p>In v.1.2.0, yourSpace will add more usability to the "todo list", allowing users to change the order of their already added lists, and goals within the lists themselves. A "breaking news" section will also be added to the new tab page, alongside a weather tab that has more information, including a 7-day forecast.</p>
    <h3>v.1.3.0</h3>
    <p>In v.1.3.0, the yourSpace team will be finished with the yourSpace forum, which is a online discussion forum that allows users to discuss with others who also want to improve their lives, in every aspect possible. There will also be a plethora of articles posted here, to encourage growth and a positive growth mindset.</p>
